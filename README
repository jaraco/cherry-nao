Cherry NAO
==========

Cherry NAO is a REST web interface for Aldebaran NAO robots. It is so named
because it uses `CherryPy <http://www.cherrypy.org>`_ for the web service
layer. CherryPy is a multi-threaded HTTP server that runs on Python, and thus
runs directly on the NAO.

By installing and running this behavior, your NAO will run a new service
on port 8080. This new service provides a robust, stateless API enabling
other applications to interact with the NAO.

Usage
=====

To demonstrate the usage of the Cherry NAO, the web service provides a simple,
Javascript-based web controller.

First install and start the behavior, then browse to the robot on port 8080.
For example, "http://nao.local:8080". A link is provided to the demo
controller; click the link to start.

You will be presented with a few demo controls:

  - volume control
  - battery level
  - installed behaviors
  - running behaviors
  - say something

API
===

The API is designed with REST principles in mind. Most operations accept and
return JSON.
